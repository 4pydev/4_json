# Prettify JSON

The program takes the path to the json file  with arbitrary data and outputs the contents of the file to the console in a **prettyprint** style.

# Quickstart

Example of script launch on Linux, Python 3.5:

```bash

$ python pprint_json.py <path to file>

"geometry": {
                "coordinates": [
                    37.63310099917504,
                    55.820912000154024
                ],
                "type": "Point"
            }

```
